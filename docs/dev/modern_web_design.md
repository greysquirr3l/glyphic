Designing a website is a process that requires a blend of creativity and technical expertise. To ensure your website offers a seamless user experience while looking aesthetically pleasing, there are some fundamental design principles to follow. Here’s a breakdown of the 10 principles of good website design based on top sources in the field:

1. Simplicity is Key
A cluttered business website design overwhelms visitors and detracts from the key message. Simplicity in design is about delivering a clear and concise message without overloading the user with unnecessary visuals, text, or features. Minimalist designs not only look clean and modern but also improve usability. Stick to essentials , limited color palettes, clean typography, and plenty of white space allowing the user to focus on the important elements of your website.

Incorporating simplicity doesn’t mean sacrificing creativity. By using well-thought-out design elements strategically, you can create a site that is visually appealing without being overly complicated. Simple websites also load faster, enhancing the user experience. Complex animations, long scrolling pages, and heavy multimedia can make navigation frustrating if not handled correctly. Keep things simple to encourage engagement and make it easier for users to digest your content.

Tip- Prioritize the user’s needs by presenting the most vital information upfront, and avoid distractions such as excessive ads or pop-ups. Ensure that each element serves a purpose and contributes to a cohesive, uncluttered experience.

2. Responsive Design for All Devices
With mobile devices accounting for a significant portion of web traffic, responsive design is crucial. A good web design should adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal functionality across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. A responsive design enhances user experience, boosts engagement, and improves SEO rankings, as search engines like Google prioritize mobile-friendly websites.

Responsive design goes beyond resizing content. It ensures that interactive elements like menus, buttons, and forms function properly on all devices. Designing for touch-screen interfaces is important for mobile users, and ensuring that the layout adapts without overwhelming small screens is critical. Consider how elements like text blocks, images, and navigation bars behave as screen sizes shift to provide a fluid and dynamic experience.

Tip- Test your website on multiple devices and use tools like Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test to ensure it meets modern usability standards. Also, make sure to consider different orientations (portrait and landscape) during the design process.

3. Intuitive Navigation
Easy and intuitive navigation is a cornerstone of good website design. Users should be able to locate what they’re looking for without excessive scrolling or clicking. A well-structured navigation bar, along with clearly labeled sections and categories, helps users find information quickly. Avoid overwhelming users with too many menu options, and instead, group related items logically.

When designing navigation, think about how users typically flow through your site. Intuitive user navigation reduces frustration and keeps users on your site longer. Breadcrumbs, dropdown menus, and search functionality can make large websites easier to explore. Make sure your navigation is accessible from every page, allowing users to return to the homepage or other key sections with ease.

Tip- Use breadcrumb navigation and sticky headers to enhance the overall user experience by allowing users to understand their current location on the site. Clear icons and simple labels also make navigation more user-friendly.

4. Fast Load Times
Speed matters. A slow-loading website can frustrate users, leading them to abandon the site entirely. Studies show that users expect a page to load in under three seconds, and a delay can result in high bounce rates. Optimizing your website’s performance by compressing images, reducing scripts, and leveraging caching ensures a smooth user experience and improves search engine rankings.

Fast load times are even more critical for mobile users, who may be accessing your site on slower connections. Reducing the size of files such as images and videos can help speed up your site without sacrificing quality. Lazy loading, which defers the loading of offscreen images until the user scrolls to them, is another useful technique. Regular performance audits can also identify any issues that slow your website down.

Tip- Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to measure and improve your website’s load speed. Additionally, consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to optimize load times for users in different geographical locations.

5. Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs)
A good website directs users to take action, whether it’s subscribing to a newsletter, purchasing a product, or filling out a contact form. CTAs should be strategically placed, visually distinct, and action-oriented. Ensure that the buttons are large enough, well-positioned, and accompanied by concise, compelling copy.

Your CTAs should guide users towards their next step, whether it’s learning more about a product, signing up for updates, or making a purchase. Use persuasive language that encourages action and make sure the buttons or links stand out from the rest of the content. A well-designed CTA can significantly improve conversion rates.

Tip- Use contrasting colors for your CTAs to make them stand out and guide the user’s eye toward the desired action. Keep the text simple, using words like “Buy Now,” “Sign Up,” or “Get Started” to encourage immediate interaction.

6. Consistent Branding
Your website should reflect your brand identity consistently throughout its design. From fonts and colors to the overall tone of your content, maintaining uniformity across all pages strengthens brand recognition. Consistent branding builds trust, enhances credibility, and ensures that users have a cohesive experience whether they’re on your homepage, blog, or checkout page.

Brand consistency also applies to your voice and messaging. Every piece of content should reflect your brand’s personality and values. This includes the tone of written content, the style of imagery, and even how you interact with users through calls-to-action or social media buttons. Consistent branding helps create a lasting impression and fosters a sense of familiarity among your users.

Tip- Develop a brand style guide to ensure all design elements, from colors to typography, align with your business’s visual identity. This will help maintain a cohesive look and feel across your entire digital presence.

7. Use of High-Quality Visuals
Images, videos, and other visual elements play a vital role in engaging visitors and communicating your brand’s message. High-quality visuals enhance the appeal of your site and improve user retention. However, balance is key; overly large files can slow down the website, while poor-quality visuals can make the site appear unprofessional.

Effective use of visuals can increase emotional engagement, convey complex information quickly, and make your site more visually appealing. Stock photos can fill gaps, but original, high-quality images related to your business can make your site feel more authentic and trustworthy. Videos, infographics, and animations can also add dynamism to your content, but they should be used sparingly to avoid overwhelming the user.

Tip: Use compressed, high-resolution images and incorporate original visuals whenever possible to convey authenticity and boost user trust. Avoid large media files that could affect site speed, and always consider the overall visual hierarchy.

8. Accessibility for All Users
An inclusive website ensures that users of all abilities can easily access its content. This includes optimizing for screen readers, offering alternative text for images, providing captions for videos, and ensuring that the design is compatible with assistive technologies. An accessible website isn’t just about ethics, it’s a legal requirement in many countries and can expand your audience reach.

Accessibility also includes designing with color blindness, cognitive impairments, and motor disabilities in mind. You should provide multiple ways to access your content (such as keyboard navigation for users who can’t use a mouse), and ensure that contrast ratios between text and background colors are high enough for readability. Designing with accessibility in mind improves usability for all users.

Tip- Follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure your website meets accessibility standards. Use tools like WAVE or Axe to audit your site’s accessibility.

9. Good Content Layout
A well-organized content layout improves readability and ensures users stay on your site longer. Break up large blocks of text with headings, subheadings, bullet points, and images. A clean and scannable layout keeps users engaged and makes it easier for them to digest information. Typography is also crucial; use readable fonts and sizes that are legible across all devices.

An effective content layout uses visual hierarchy to guide users through your site. Use larger fonts for headings, and vary font sizes and weights to indicate importance. Make sure that text is properly spaced to avoid overwhelming the user with dense blocks of information. Each piece of content should be easy to scan and understand quickly.

Tip- Use a visual hierarchy to emphasize important content, guiding users through your site in a logical flow. Don’t be afraid to incorporate white space to give your content room to breathe and help users focus on key information.

10. SEO-Friendly Structure
A beautiful custom web design is only effective if users can find it. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a must for driving organic traffic. A good website structure includes SEO best practices, such as clean URLs, proper use of headings, fast load times, and mobile-friendliness. Optimizing meta tags, alt text for images, and content with relevant keywords can significantly improve your site’s visibility on search engines.

An SEO-friendly website structure also includes well-organized navigation, internal linking, and structured data markup to help search engines understand the content better. Regular updates to your content, along with proper indexing and crawling, will ensure your site stays visible in search results. Furthermore, user-friendly design and fast load times are also important factors for SEO.

Tip- Regularly update your website with fresh content and perform SEO audits to ensure your site remains competitive in search rankings. Incorporate keywords naturally into your content and use SEO tools to analyze performance.

Conclusion

Designing a successful website requires more than just aesthetics. A truly great website combines design, functionality, and user experience to create an environment that encourages engagement, fosters trust, and achieves business goals. By following these 10 principles of good website design, you’ll create a platform that not only attracts visitors but also keeps them coming back.

The world of website design is constantly evolving. As new technologies emerge, new website design principles are born. Something that was standard practice two years ago may no longer be effective today.

For example, two decades ago, it was sensible to build websites with fixed widths and layouts. People only used PCs and didn’t have access to different types of devices. So, website design experts strictly created designs for fixed-width websites (approximately 960 pixels wide), expecting them to deliver fairly consistent user experiences to end-users.

A decade later, browsing the Internet on smartphones became the norm. The way people interacted with websites changed forever. Websites with fixed widths and layouts were rejected by smartphone users. So, in 2010, a new concept called “responsive web design” was created by web designer Ethan Marcotte.

Banner banner-4
He consolidated three existing website design techniques…

Flexible grid layouts
Flexible images
Flexible media and media queries
…into one integrated approach and called it responsive web design. Those website designers who were ahead of the curve in 2010, quickly modified their design principles to make the most of this rising trend. A little over a decade later, over 60% of all global website traffic comes from mobile phones.

That is why it is essential for web and UI/UX design professionals to consistently keep up with the latest technological advancements and trends. If they do not, they won’t be able to future-proof their products and designs.

The New Principles of Website Design
10 principles of good website design
As technology evolves, the choices and expectations of people also evolve with time. While the primary motive of UI/UX designers will always be to solve their users’ problems and to provide them with a memorable experience, the approach to do so keeps improvising. So, standing in 2023, what are the guidelines that can lead to an excellent experience?

Here are the new, updated principles of good website design that are applicable in 2023 and the decade that lies ahead.

1. Responsive Design
Optimise Each Design Element for Mobile Users

If your website’s goal is to generate repeat visits, mobile navigability and responsive layouts should be your two key design priorities. In a recent survey conducted by Google, 80% of participants claimed that they’re likelier to return to websites and web apps that are mobile-friendly. To make mobile experiences seamless, mobile and web app design experts:

Include only essential visual cues and design elements on the mobile version of the site to ensure it doesn’t look cluttered. Logos, menus, call-to-action buttons, and social media icons are the four essential design elements of this era.
Use eye-catching fonts to make all text pages (About Us, Service pages, etc.) easier to scan.
Resize all page elements including blocks of text and all media files for easier user interaction on mobiles.
Websites that lack these design features don’t load correctly on different types of devices, causing usability issues and deterring users. Opting for responsive website design services can eliminate these problems, ensuring your site provides a fluid experience on any device, keeping users engaged and coming back for more.

2. Smooth Performance & Load Time
Keep Improving the Website’s Load Time Metrics

Slow load times have indelible impacts on visitor experiences, especially for first-time visitors. In the long run, they significantly diminish websites’ ability to convert. Understanding how fast your web pages load and constantly improving upon that time is a critical part of a web designer’s job.

Banner banner-2
Seasoned web designers speed up load times and outperform their competitors’ websites by taking various steps, such as:

Make the website 100% mobile responsive
Resize and optimise media files
Compress all images on the website
Minify CSS/JS Files
Limit 301 Redirects
Run JavaScript last
3. Balancing Consistency and Innovation 
Use Familiar Web Design Conventions

Consistency is an eternal principle of web design. When the behaviour of all interactive design elements on a website is consistent with the end user’s expectations, the experience is smooth and intuitive. But, what if you want to be innovative with your designs? Should you stick to age-old conventions of information architecture, interaction design, and visual design?

Or should you choose consistency? Consider the following example to find the answers to these questions:

You want to present your website’s search bar in an innovative way.
But, your end-user may want the search bar to be in the same place it is on most websites.
Moving the search bar to the bottom of the page might be innovative. But, it’s not what the average website user has come to know and expect.
Your innovative design trick could cause usability issues for your target users.
In web design, there will always be tensions between consistency and innovation. Whenever web designers feel confused between the two, they should stick to familiar web design conventions. Enabling visitors to find information on the website quickly and confidently should be the aim of every web designer.

Banner banner-3
To achieve this aim, they must stick to age-old conventions of information architecture, interaction design, and visual design. However, web designers have all the freedom to innovate when it comes to making certain actions or functions on their websites easier and quicker for their users. They also have the freedom to innovate with their websites’ visual language.

4. Innovative, Yet Effective Visual Language
Each brand and each website has its own story. All visual elements of a website should be designed to represent this unique story.  So, web designers must use a clear and distinct mixture of imagery, colours, icons, typography, and other visual elements to create a unique brand identity for the website.

Using powerful and distinct visual language is the key to creating a recognisable UI. Combine that with well-written content, and you can create a website that’s hard to forget and impossible not to enjoy.

5. Hierarchical Content Structure
Designed to Facilitate Visitor Actions

When professional website designers design a brand-new website or upgrade an existing one, they ask two important questions:

What are the main business objectives of this website?
How should the different pages of the website be designed to achieve those objectives?
From there, they map out a basic visual hierarchy for the website. They structure the content on the website meaningfully and logically to make it well-organised and easy to digest. They use visual design techniques to ensure that the most important design elements on each page receive the most emphasis.These visual design techniques include using contrasting imagery, efficient use of white space, and user-centric content alignment. By creating such hierarchical visual and content structures, web designers subtly guide their target users. They advance their journeys on the website from “aware” to “interested” to “engaged.”

6. Align Design and Content
A website’s design and content are like the lyrics and chords for a song. They should always be created together. When a website’s content doesn’t match its design, visitors feel that their experiences are jarring and disjointed. When it does, user experiences feel organic and harmonious.

The written content, interactive components, and visual elements of a website should all be in sync. They should work together to cohesively communicate a clear brand message. That’s why website designers and content creators work together early on in the design process. They must be clear on the types of messages they want to convey to target users.

7. Align Design and SEO
Online visibility is key to making your website easily accessible to target users. Web designers must make SEO a key part of their web design strategies to improve their websites’ visibility. Of course, web designers and SEO professionals don’t usually work together. But, there are many things web designers can do to create SEO-friendly web designs. These include:

Breaking up text in the right spaces to ensure it works well with other interactive elements on the page.
Leaving space for content creators to add SEO-optimised headlines, image captions, and subheads on each web page.
Using SEO-friendly URL design to strengthen the website’s ranking signals.
Using intentional, well-designed CTAs on each page to simplify navigation.
8. Ensure Frictionless Conversions
Signing up, subscribing, or making purchases on the website should be as frictionless as possible for users. To achieve this objective, web designers must eliminate all points of friction from their designs. Some examples of friction points on websites include:

Distracting visuals
Confusing labels
Unclear CTAs  
Small, hard-to-use menu options
All conversion elements on a website: from the sitemap menu to all purchase buttons, should be self-explanatory and easy to access.

9. Always Test Your Prototypes
Before finalising a design, the best web designers always deploy skilled testers to examine all aspects of the website. The testers repeatedly examine the websites across different devices, platforms, and browsers. Once the tests reveal all the flaws in the design, web designers use this info to root out all errors and improve the website’s overall usability.

10. Latest Web Design Trends
Website design is a constantly evolving field. Hence, the principles of good website design are also ever-evolving. In the upcoming decade,

Banner banner-6
The number of people using smaller-screen devices to access the Internet will keep growing.
At the other end of the spectrum, more and more people will access the Internet via their smart TVs and console devices.
The difference in size between the smallest and the largest screens browsing the web has never been bigger and it will keep growing.
Website designers will now have to cater to two types of users. Those who access the Internet using 4.7-inch mobile screens. And, those who use 40-inch ultra-wide TV screen displays.
That’s why it’s so important for web and UI/UX design professionals to keep learning and evolving. By exploring various design trends like neubrutalism web design, glassmorphism design, and many others, you can incorporate diverse principles and techniques to create high-quality website experiences for your target users. Use these everlasting website design principles to stay ahead and deliver exceptional results!

What is The Neubrutalism Or Neo Brutalism Web Design Trend
Design Studio
Design Studio
Updated: 25 April 2025
Neubrutalism Trend in Web Design
Neubrutalism in web design is a trend characterized by minimalist aesthetics, stark typography, and a raw, unpolished appearance. It emphasizes simplicity, functionality, and a departure from traditional design principles, often using bold colors and asymmetrical layouts.

In the wild world of web design, there is a new ‘cool kid’ on the block: Neubrutalism.  Characterized by strongly defined shapes, audacious ‘in-your-face’ fonts, and daringly high contrasts, neubrutalism in web design is a bleak departure from the sleek contours of minimalism, and the raw, unforgiving aesthetics of brutalism. Its unapologetic embrace of rawness and imperfection sets neubrutalism apart from pretty much every other web design trend in the 21st century.

That is why neubrutalism is more than just a stylistic preference; it is a statement of defiance against the notion that web design must always conform to ultra-polished and heavily-refined aesthetics. In other words, neubrutalism deliberately breaks the conventional norms of traditional web design to ‘up the ante’ and create unforgettable website experiences for visitors.

Banner banner-1
It defies the conventional norms of web design, favoring raw and unadorned HTML structures (reminiscent of the early 90s UI design ethos) over fancy, over-complicated interfaces. It challenges traditional color theory, almost exclusively uses unconventional typography, and at every chance, favors simplicity over complexity.

Here are some other core characteristics of neubrutalism that illustrate how this design trend goes against traditional design sensibilities and pushes the boundaries of what is considered ‘appropriate’ in the world of digital design:

Raw and Unprocessed Aesthetic: Neubrutalism embraces a raw, unprocessed aesthetic to create a sense of authenticity and vividness.
Bold and Contrasting Colors: To challenge conventional color theory and create a visually striking viewing experience, of neubrutalism in web design employ bold color palettes with contrasting hues.
Sharp Lines and Geometric Shapes: Sharp lines and geometric shapes are the go-tos in neubrutalism. They create a sense of order and structure amidst the overarching rawness of the design.
Minimalistic Layouts: Neubrutalism might be wild, but it has no room for clutter. Clean lines, wide spaces, and plenty of negative space are all ploys neubrutalists use to keep the key elements of their design front and center.
Emphasis on Raw Emotion: Through the use of clashing colors, stark contrasts, and an overarching sense of visual disruption, neubrutalism seeks to evoke raw emotions.
Adaptability: Its focus on simplicity, functionality, and authenticity translates well across all devices, screen sizes, and formats. Neubrutalist websites typically deliver consistent user experiences across both desktop and mobile devices.
Despite these stand-out characteristics, neubrutalism does not exactly have everyone swooning in the world of web design. Many in the design community are still figuring out how to feel about chaotic web graphics, razor-sharp color contrasts, and design layouts that can be a bit of a headache to implement.

Let us dive deep into the unconventional world of neubrutalism in web design, answering important questions like:

What is neubrutalism in web design?
How does brutalism relate to neubrutalism in web design?
What are the main aesthetic features of neubrutalism?
Prominent, real-world examples to neubrutalism in web design.
What is Neubrutalism or Neo Brutalism in Web Design?
What is Neubrutalism in Web Design
To understand neubrutalism, we first need to understand its roots in brutalist architecture. Brutalism is an architectural design movement that emerged in Europe & North America in the 1950s. This design style was characterized by its stark, utilitarian aesthetic. The term ‘brutalism’ itself was derived from the French phrase ‘béton-brut,’ which means ‘raw concrete.’ In the 90s, brutalism found its way into the world of UX and UI design. This digital offshoot of brutalist architectural design favored simple, functional elements that prioritize content and usability over fancy graphics and intricate layouts.

Now, brutalism’s stripped-down style might not have been everyone’s cup of tea. But, web designers respected the rebellious spirit of brutalism. That rebellious spirit earned it a dedicated fan club of designers that still cheers it on today.

Banner banner-3
Neubrutalism built upon the raw aesthetic of its predecessor, retaining characteristics like bold typography, contrasting color palettes, and over-exposed structural elements. On top of that brutalist base, neubrutalism infused brutalism’s rawness with a modern sensibility, incorporating more movement and present-day design elements like animation, illustration, asymmetrical layouts, and new-age typography.

Aesthetic Features of Neubrutalism in Web Design
While the exact origin of the term “Neubrutalism” may be unclear, the term was popularized by web designers like Michał Malewicz in the early 2020s. Since then, its bold and unapologetic approach has resonated strongly both with designers and users who love unique web designs that deliver stimulating and memorable visual experiences.

Here are some of the key visual/aesthetic characteristics of neubrutalist web design:

Clashing Colors
Clashing Colors - Neubrutalism Feature
Neubrutalists will not shy away from making controversial color-related decisions like merging pure black (#000000) with vibrant hues like neon yellow (#FFFF00) or fiery orange (#FFA500). That is a practice that most other web designers avoid because they do not want to risk straining the users’ eyes. But, neubrutalism is never afraid to stand out, even if it means causing mild inconvenience for users. 

Flat Color Backgrounds
Flat Color Backgrounds - Neubrutalism Feature
Neubrutalism favors the use of flat color backgrounds because they set the perfect, clutter-free stage for the chaos that is about to follow. The flat color aesthetic serves as the perfect background for bold, legible typography, contrasting brand colors, and visually striking design elements. These elements take center stage and appear to ‘pop out’ on the screen. This approach highlights the importance of color psychology in web design, as the choice of flat colors and high contrast creates visual impact and influences how users perceive and interact with the design. That is why neubrutalism in web design is often likened to the ‘pop art’ graphic design aesthetic of the 60s.

No Shadows
No Shadows - Neubrutalism Feature
To create the pop-art effect, neubrutalists make many subtle design decisions. Instead of barely visible borders (common in most web designs), they place thick, dark, and well-defined outlines around the design elements. So, instead of soft shadows, users see solid black rectangles around every major design element.

Conservative Typography
Conservative Typography - Neubrutalism Feature
While it is fair to call most aspects of neubrutalist ‘unconventional,’ when it comes to typography, it is a whole different story. Unlike the “cool” fonts used in modern minimalism or classic brutalism, neubrutalism typically opts for safer, easy-to-read fonts. Yes, web designers may stretch or convolute the fonts in weird ways. But, maximum readability is their main goal and they achieve it by making weird backgrounds/colors meet legible, geometrically lucid text.

Computer-Window Pattern
Computer-Window Pattern 
Neubrutalism often incorporates elements of computer windows, such as minimize/maximize buttons. This adds a touch of nostalgia to the viewing experience because users feel like they’re browsing on the classic Windows 7 or Mac interface.

Illustrations and Animations
Illustrations and animations never went along with minimalism or brutalism. But, neubrutalism makes it work. Neubrutalism places modern graphics and animations on flat colors. These contrasting hues breathe life into the design, creating an aesthetic that’s near-impossible to look away from. Many web designers will deliberately choose slightly off-kilter illustrations/graphics to make their work even more eye-catching.

Other ways of achieving this goal include making new-age graphics overlap HD photos and then making all the design elements mobile. As users scroll through the graphics, they get to see a captivating parallax effect. Without such effects, the aesthetic appeal of neubrutalist websites would be a lot lower.

It’s clear from these characteristics that neubrutalism gives designers something that other web design styles/trends typically don’t: the chance to experiment and make unconventional design choices. That’s why several brands, design agencies, and individual web designers across the world have adopted this design style with open arms.

Real-World Examples of Neubrutalism 
Here are some real-world examples of neubrutalism in web design:

Atomby Shopify Theme by Whiley Mai: Flat colors in the background. Bold headings. A contrasting color palette. This Shopify theme nails the neubrutalism web design vibe with its edgy and minimalist interface.

Adobe Figma: No shadows in its imagery. Well-defined, dark-black lines outline each design element, making them ‘pop-out.’ The deliberate clash of vibrant hues, like orange and yellow commands attention. All of these features make Figma’s website a prime example of neubrutalist web design.

Banner banner-5
Gumroad: Gumroad is a platform where independent creators, artists, musicians, and other digital content creators sell their work/products directly to consumers. What better way to attract such users than a super-neubrutalist web design? Muted, clashing colors devoid of gradients. Visually striking illustrations & graphics. Design elements with bold black outlines. Easy-to-read, conventional typography. If you visit the Gumroad website, you’ll even see a bunch of animations pop up.

Final Take
Neubrutalism is a design style that champions functionality over form. That’s why it will always be more than just a passing web design trend. Web designers love the relaxed rules of neubrutalism regarding composition/shapes/colors because it enables them to push their boundaries of expression, often combining it with styles like glassmorphism for a visually striking interface. For brands, the allure is in the promise of websites that not only stand out but also prioritize user-friendly legibility, navigation, and functionality.

Glassmorphism Key Takeaways
Make UIs look like frosted glass – that’s what the Glassmorphism trend is all about.
Designers layer semi-transparent design elements over colorful, blurry backgrounds to create this frosted effect.
Depth. Focus. Modernity. Cleanliness. Sleekness. Minimalist Style. These are the qualities this design style adds to UIs.
Apple and Microsoft made Glassmorphism famous. Now it’s used in every other dashboard, widget, app onboarding screen, and more.
Frosted panels. Layered cards. Bold backgrounds. Soft shadows. Thin borders. These are Glassmorphism’s key design traits.
It’s perfect for creating beautiful, immersive design segments in apps and websites.
What is Glassmorphism in UI Design?
Glassmorphism is a UI design style. It makes interface elements look like frosted glass. The semi-transparent elements float above a colorful background. This creates a sense of depth. It makes layouts feel layered.

The goal of glassmorphism design is to create an interface that looks like an assortment of glassy panels hovering in the background space. By “glass-morphing” the design elements, UI designers give them an “airy” feeling. They have the appearance of frosted virtual glass and look like they are floating in the background.

Glassmorphism adds a touch of minimalism, modernity, sleekness, and a futuristic appearance to web and app interfaces. It makes interfaces appear simple yet sophisticated. Like neumorphism design in UI, glassmorphism is a relatively new app design trend. But it is already one of the most popular app design trends of the 2020s.

Banner banner-1
Glassmorphism helps designers add visual hierarchy to their creations and create focal points for the content they want to highlight. That is why popular brands like Microsoft and Apple have embraced the glassmorphism design style. The inclusion of glassmorphism design in MacOS’s Big Sur in 2020 is a good example of the popularity of this design trend.

Let’s see an example:

Card with glassmorphic design.
Source: Dribbble
Notice how the transparent card appears as if it is floating in space? The same effect that you see in this card, can be recreated for CTA buttons, dashboards, onboarding screens, and more. It can also be used to design windows or widgets. For example, this redesign of the Messenger App for MacOS illustrates the perfect use of glassmorphism:

Messenger app with glassmorphic design.
Source: Dribbble
This app window with its frosted glass-like appearance and semi-transparent elements looks so much classier than a traditionally designed app window, right? It is no surprise that this modern app design trend has been embraced by tech giants like Apple. In fact, Apple used the frosted glass effect long before this design style was given the status of a certified trend.

If you have an iPhone or iPad, just look at the widgets on your home screen. Do you notice the semi-transparent elements and the frosted glass effect? Here is an example:

Apple had started using glassmorphism long before it became a trend.
Source: Tutplus
Do you notice the traces of glassmorphism? Now that you have a clear idea of what glassmorphism looks like in app design, let’s lay down the key principles or characteristics of this design trend.

Key Principles of Glassmorphism Design
Key Principles of Glassmorphism Design
The core principle is frosted transparency. Designers achieve this effect by using a background blur on an object. Multi-layered layouts. Layered elements (like stacked glass). Bold color backgrounds (essential). Soft drop shadows. Subtle border strokes. These are the other key elements of Glassmorphism.

Banner banner-6
Unlike age-old design styles and trends like Brutalism or Neubrutalism, glassmorphism is relatively new, and it does not have a fixed set of design principles. But, there are certain features that can be immediately identified with glassmorphism. They are:

Frosted Glass-Like Appearance
Icons, buttons, windows, and other UI elements look translucent or semi-transparent. They look like they are made of frosted virtual glass.

Multi-Layered Style
Glassmorphic designs are inherently multi-layered. Typically, these designs feature a translucent background over a vividly-colored background. This multi-layer style gives the interface elements a 3D effect. 

Colorful Background
Choosing bright colors for the background is an easy way to further highlight the glass-like appearance of the interface elements. The bright, vivid colors in the background contrast with the glass-like, semi-transparent elements, demonstrating the role of color psychology. This contrast creates a visible blur around the interface elements. The blurring adds depth to the design and boosts the visual hierarchy of the UI design. Light colors will also work but won’t give the depth that bright, busy backgrounds do.

Shadows
If you add a shadow effect to the different layers in the multi-layered design, you can create a sense of depth and give each layer a three-dimensional appearance. 

Border Highlighting
Interface elements in Glassmorphic UI designs typically feature border highlights. These highlights/accents help define their shape.

Banner banner-7
These principles of Glassmorphic design will be easier to understand once you review the history of this app design trend, particularly its name.

A Brief History of Glassmorphism
The style has roots in designs like Apple’s iOS 7 and Microsoft’s Fluent Design System. “Glass” + “morphism” = “Glassmorphism.” UI Designer Michal Malewicz coined this term. 

The term “Glassmorphism” was coined in 2020 and popularized by the well-known UI designer Michal Malewicz in the same year. According to Malewicz, when users see a Glassmorphic design, they see different layers on top of each other. Each of these layers looks like pieces of “virtual glass.” Hence, naming this design style “Glassmorphism” made sense.

But, the idea of giving UI elements a glass-like appearance dates way back to the 2013 iOS update. In this update, the iOS menu (check the previous image) was re-designed. It now featured semi-transparent interface elements with the frosted glass effect. The seeds of Glassmorphism as a design style were planted.

Four years later, Microsoft launched the Fluent Design System: a design language for creating UIs that are visually appealing and accessible. This design system came with a background effect called “Acrylic Material.” This semi-transparent, blurred background effect was inspired by the look of glass. Some key characteristics of this blurred background effect include:

Semi-transparent backgrounds to create a sense of depth. 
Giving the UI elements blurred edges and other features that make them look like they are made of glass.
Light and shadow to make the UI elements look like they are floating in space.
In other words, by using the “Acrylic Material” effect, designers could easily add Glassmorphic elements to their interface designs. Three years later, Apple launched the macOS Big Sur update and added similar translucent and glass-like visual elements to its operating system.

These changes made the OS look more modern and elegant. Pretty soon, UI designers from across the world were raving about how good glass-like visual elements looked on UI designs. By 2020, the status of Glassmorphism as a certified app design trend was solidified. Here is a brief chart detailing the evolution of the Glassmorphism app design trend:

2022: Glassmorphism is featured in a number of popular apps and websites like Canva.
In 2025 (and beyond) glassmorphism will only keep increasing in popularity. Why? Because employing this design style makes a lot of sense in a variety of scenarios.

Why Use Glassmorphism in Web or App UI Design?

Because it’s cool! It helps create a visual hierarchy and makes the interface feel alive. It guides users visually. It stands out from flat designs. The frosted glass effect makes important elements, like a login card, stand out. 

Adding Visual Hierarchy
Glassmorphism can be used to create a sense of depth in an app UI. This sense of depth adds visual weight to certain interface elements. Hence, a visual hierarchy can be formed by using Glassmorphic effects. For example, you can make a button stand out from the background in an interface by giving it a Glassmorphic effect.

Highlighting Content
Glassmorphism can be used to draw attention to important content sections. For example, you can make a notification appear as if it is floating above the background.

Designing Onboarding Screens
Since Glassmorphism gives users a sense of depth, visual appeal, and immersion, it is ideal for designing onboarding screens for mobile apps. Here is an example:

Conclusion
Overall, Glassmorphism is an ultra-versatile design style that has many use cases. It can be used to create engaging and interactive interfaces. Aspects of this design style can also be used to create various effects in UI and web design. It is perfect for creating beautiful, immersive design segments in apps and websites. If you want to create a modern, sleek, and visually appealing UI, Glassmorphism is the way to go.
